# A01: NLP in Pop Culture – Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S.

For this assignment, I explored how Natural Language Processing (NLP) appears in pop culture. The goal was to think about how language-based technology works by breaking it down into basic actions, without using technical terms yet.

### Part 1: Pop Culture Example
One of my favorite examples of AI that uses language is **J.A.R.V.I.S.**, the voice assistant in the *Iron Man* movies. J.A.R.V.I.S. talks with Tony Stark, follows his voice commands, provides updates, and even holds conversations like a real person.

### Part 2: What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?
If J.A.R.V.I.S. were real, it would need to do a few important things to understand and respond to Tony:
- **Listen and recognize his voice**
- **Understand what the words mean**
- **Reply with helpful and relevant answers**
- **React to emotions or urgency in his voice**

This made me realize how many steps are involved in something that feels so simple when we watch it in a movie.

### Part 3: Class Discussion
I posted my response in the class discussion and replied to a classmate who used a different movie example. I added my thoughts on what their AI might need to do and connected it to J.A.R.V.I.S.

This assignment was a fun way to start thinking about NLP in a real-world context, using familiar characters and technology from movies.
