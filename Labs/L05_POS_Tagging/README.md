# Lab 05: Part-of-Speech Tagging in the Real World

In this lab, I explored how NLP tools identify parts of speech in text and how this can be used in real-world applications like chatbots and customer support analysis.

## Topics Covered
- POS tagging with NLTK and SpaCy
- Ambiguity in tagging (e.g., “book” as noun or verb)
- Comparing different taggers
- Real-life transcript analysis

## Key Takeaways
- POS tagging is crucial for understanding sentence structure.
- Some words can have different meanings based on context.
- Different tools may tag the same text differently.

## Tools Used
- NLTK
- SpaCy
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
